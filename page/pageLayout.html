        <p>Before the Norse people(more popularly known as vikings) converted into Christianity during the middle ages, they had a deep sense of belief at the mystical powers and pagan traditions that are interwoven in their lifestyle. These stories and legends revolved around the Gods such as Odin, Thor, Freya, Loki, and the like</p>

        <p>Ymir was the first of godlike destructive giants. When Odin and his brothers slew their parent giant, they set about constructing the world from his remains. They fashioned the oceans from his blood, the soil from his skin and muscles, vegetation from his hair, clouds from his brains, and the sky from his skull.</p>

        <p>Let us now dive deep into the world of Norse religion, particularly the legendary cosmology that was taught to them by their early ancestors. Links could be found on the navigation tab. Enjoy.</p>
