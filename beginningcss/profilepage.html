    <p>I am currently studying at BYU Hawaii, majoring in Computer Science. I like how computers have the ability to automate heapton of work for us humans. These tools aid us by removing <q>manual labor</q> from our hands so we can put our attention to what matters most. What matters most to me is my family, my love ones, and having wholesome fun and recreation. Computers help humans be more productive.</p> 


    <p>My favorite quote is:</p>
    <blockquote>&#34;The <strong>more</strong> you <strong>sweat</strong> in practice, the <strong>less</strong> you <strong>bleed</strong> in battle.&#34;
        <br>- <em>George S. Patton Jr</em>
