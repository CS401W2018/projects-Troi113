        <h2>Rating</h2>
        <p>I would give an overall rating of <b>4.8/5</b></p>

        <h2>Best Season</h2>
        <p>Best season for this fragrance would be Fall. It has an oriental, woody, and sweet notes that might be polarizing for the summer. This is perfect for cold weather, especially for date nights. </p>

        <h2>Gender</h2>
        <p>This leans towards <b>extremely masculine</b></p>

        <h2>Sillage</h2>
        <p>Based on experience, I need to spray twice on a spot in order for the sillage to cover a good area. I would put the Sillage rating on <b>moderate</b></p>

        <h2>Performance</h2>
        <p>The scent is <b>long-lasting</b>. I spray on it one time for a date and went to bed with the scent. I woke up and the scent still lingers.</p>
