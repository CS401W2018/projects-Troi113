        <p>Burberry Hero EDP is a perfume for men. The profileo of this fragrance is woody, cedar, warm and spicy. It is mainly a wood scent, using three different kinds of cedar as the base scent. </p>

        <p>Hero is a scent that invokes a modern take on gentlemen scents. It's spicy and woody profile suggest a sophisticated image a lot of men identifies themselves as.</p>

        <h2>Rating</h2>
        <p>I would give an overall rating of <b>4/5</b></p>

        <p>It is a very good winter or fall fragrance. If you are a fan of cedar, which I am, this is a scent for you. It is a well rounded and versatile fragrance, but very subtle. It is a linear scent which might be boring for some, but it makes it easier and wearable for every occasion.</p>

        <p>Here are some Cons listed below which you could watch out for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Could be too heavy for hot weather</li>
            <li>Some people say it is uninspired and lacks creativity.</li>
            <li>Fragrance has been done before. Very similar and holds the same dna as to Armani Stronger with you intensely</li>
            <li>Pine notes does not stay very well</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Best Season</h2>
        <p>Best season for this fragrance would be <b>Winter and Fall</b>. It's amber, benzoin, and cedar profile are great characteristics of a versatile perfume. This could be worn as a morning scent but will fall short if worn at a late-night party.</p>

        <h2>Gender</h2>
        <p>This leans towards <b>extremely masculine</b></p>

        <h2>Sillage</h2>
        <p>Burberry Hero has a moderate sillage. The perfume doesn't emanate the room and is very subtle. If you want compliments, you would have to stand closer to people for them to notice it, or spray a little bit more to strengthen the sillage.</p>

        <h2>Performance</h2>
        <p>The scent is <b>moderate</b>-lasting. Whenever I spray it in the mornings, The scent is usually gone by mid-afternoon. I have to respray it for the scent to last until the evening.</p>
