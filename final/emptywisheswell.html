        <h2>Empty Wishes Well</h2>
        <p>Toskovat is a young, upcoming perfume manufacturer. It's main nose is David-Lev Jipa-Slivinschi, who started his perfumer debut in 2022. One of his first fragrances was Empty Wishes Well. This fragrance is publicly acclaimed as a niche and unique scent. </p>

        <blockquote>&quot;
            Today I remembered making wishes and having hope.<br>
            <br>
            I found this rusty old coin in my pocket, from somebody I can’t recall, from a place I don’t know, with a purpose it hasn’t served. When I was a child and I would find them, I’d keep them until I saw the first well and I would make a wish.<br>
            <br>
            But now money doesn’t make wishes come true, and there is no well. They dried up. Father told me the holy water font became mouldy. Marble cracked and prayers turned to dust on walls.<br>
            <br>
            But I still have my hope. I know rain will come and I will melt in the soil I walked on and nature will bring nurture. And more shall live again.
            &quot;

        <h2>Rating</h2>
        <p>I would give an overall rating of <b>3.5/5</b></p>

        <p>Here are some pointers what explains my rating:</p>

        <p><b>Pros</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unique scent, probably nothing you smelled before</li>
            <li>Leans slightly masculine</li>
            <li>Smell of moss and damp rain that might be satisfying to some</li>
            <li>Sage and vetiver adds a very green and fresh feeling</li>
            <li>Deep, non-linear scent that changes as time goes</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Cons</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Not a compliment getter. wore this a couple of times and the scent never got noticed</li>
            <li>Might smell polarizing and old-fashioned for some because of the rusty coin note.</li>
            <li>Super overpriced. One full bottle is $260.</li>
            <li>Overpowering petrichor that might cause dizzyness or headache to some</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In my opinion, the pros does not compensate the risk. It is a very difficult fragrance to go about. But in conclusion, this fragrance is a unique green fragrances that is still very wearable despite its ability to be overpowering.</p>

        <h2>Best Season</h2>
        <p>This is a <b>fall</b> and <b>spring</b> fragrance. It invokes a earthy, green, and mossy scent that might not match summer or winter seasons very well. </p>

        <h2>Gender</h2>
        <p>This leans towards <b>slightly masculine</b></p>

        <h2>Sillage</h2>
        <p>Based on experience, I need to spray twice on a spot in order for the sillage to cover a good area. I would put the Sillage rating on <b>moderate</b></p>

        <h2>Performance</h2>
        <p>The scent is <b>long-lasting</b> on my skin(overnight), but might also be <b>extremely long-lasting</b> depending on skin types.What I mean by that is that it could last for a few days. I sprayed it on a corner of a room one time and the scen t lingered for three days.</p>
