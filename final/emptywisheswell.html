        <p>Toskovat is a young, upcoming perfume manufacturer. It's main nose is David-Lev Jipa-Slivinschi, who started his perfumer debut in 2022. One of his first fragrances was Empty Wishes Well. This fragrance is publicly acclaimed as a niche and unique scent. </p>

        <p>This purfume follows a <a href="https://www.toskovat.com/product/empty-wishes-well/">storytelling</a> of a rusted coin below a dried up wishing well. Jipa-Slivinschi's vision was to recreate a scenery that embodies hope that someday, the empty well will be doused in water that life will continue on. </p>

        <h2>Rating</h2>
        <p>I would give an overall rating of <b>3.5/5</b></p>

        <p>Here are some pointers what explains my rating:</p>

        <p><b>Pros</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unique scent, probably nothing you smelled before</li>
            <li>Leans slightly masculine</li>
            <li>Smell of moss and damp rain that might be satisfying to some</li>
            <li>Sage and vetiver adds a very green and fresh feeling</li>
            <li>Deep, non-linear scent that changes as time goes</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Cons</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Not a compliment getter. wore this a couple of times and the scent never got noticed</li>
            <li>Might smell polarizing and old-fashioned for some because of the rusty coin note.</li>
            <li>Super overpriced. One full bottle is $260.</li>
            <li>Overpowering petrichor that might cause dizzyness or headache to some</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In my opinion, the pros does not compensate the risk. It is a very difficult fragrance to go about. But in conclusion, this fragrance is a unique green fragrances that is still very wearable despite its ability to be overpowering.</p>

        <h2>Best Season</h2>
        <p>This is a <b>fall</b> and <b>spring</b> fragrance. It invokes a earthy, green, and mossy scent that might not match summer or winter seasons very well. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="textbox">
        <h2>Gender</h2>
        <p>This leans towards <b>slightly masculine</b></p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div class="textbox">
        <h2>Sillage</h2>
        <p>Based on experience, I need to spray twice on a spot in order for the sillage to cover a good area. I would put the Sillage rating on <b>moderate</b></p>
    </div>
    <div class="textbox">
        <h2>Performance</h2>
        <p>The scent is <b>long-lasting</b> on my skin(overnight), but might also be <b>extremely long-lasting</b> depending on skin types.What I mean by that is that it could last for a few days. I sprayed it on a corner of a room one time and the scen t lingered for three days.</p>
