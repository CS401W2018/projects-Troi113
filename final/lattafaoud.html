        <h2>Lattafa Ameer Al Oudh - Oud Intense </h2>

        
        <p>Oud Intense by Lattafa Perfumes is a Middle-Eastern scent for both men and women. This is a very young scent, launched at 2021. It is a combination of warm, spicy, woody, smokey, and gourmand profiles. If you plan on lounging around at home in a cold winter night, this is a perfume for you.</p>

        <p>It has been dubbed as a middle-eastern version and/or clone of Margiela By the Fireplace. It holds the smokey profile of By the Fireplace with an added oriental and gourmand spices to it such as vanilla and saffron.</p>

        <h2>Rating</h2>
        <p>I would give an overall rating of <b>4.3/5</b></p>

        <p>Here are some pointers what explains my rating:</p>

        <p><b>Pros</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>It has a very affordable price range which is good if you're starting out </li>
            <li>Sweet and creamy scent note coming from the vanilla and sugar</li>
            <li>Long-lasting and non-linear which takes you on a wild journey</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Cons</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Leans very masculine albeit being marketed as unisex fragrance</li>
            <li>Could be too coying and sweet for warm weather</li>
            <li>Could be nauseating for people who dont like middle-eastern scents</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To me, this scent is not to be worn for date nights or running errands in the morning. This is supposed to be worn on a vacation or just lounging around the house. This scent invokes a spirit of campfire, replicating the image of a middle-eastern household roasting marshmallows and having warm conversations.</p>

        <h2>Best Season</h2>
        <p>This is a <b>winter</b> fragrance. Because of its campfire vibes, it shines very well on winter nights. The woodiness and smokeyness of the scent is reminiscent of campfire grounds with loveones with an herbal, oriental profile.</p>

        <h2>Gender</h2>
        <p>This leans towards <b>slightly masculine</b></p>

        <h2>Sillage</h2>
        <p>>I would put the Sillage rating on <b>Strong</b>. It is a scent that could fill up a room when sprayed efficiently. Definitely a headturner and could reach far-corners of a room.</p>

        <h2>Performance</h2>
        <p>The scent is a very <b>long-lasting</b> perfume. Alongside its performance is its non-linear scent profile which changes overtime. It starts as an oriental floral fragrance, then evolves into a gourmand, sweet, almost edible vanilla. As the scent settles down, you can find masculine smoke and oud with hints of leather and sandalwood.</p>
